The variables in the tidy data set are the following:

```
Subject         -describes the volunteer who participated in the experiment coded by a number that stands for each participant

Activity        -describes the activity that the participant was doing while the data were collected

Means and SDs   -all the following columns contain the mean values for each feature for each subject and they either describe the average acceleration in a certain direction (...Mean..) or the standard deviation for the measured accelerations in each direction (...Std..). The units are radians/second.
```
